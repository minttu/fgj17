tyrsky/release
==============

Requirements
------------

You need to install [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/).
LÖVE is supported on Windows XP+, Mac OS X 10.7+, Ubuntu 14.04 - 16.10 and many other Linux distributions, Android, and iOS.
We didn't make the UI work on smartphones, but technically it might run.

Running
-------

In graphical environments double clicking `tyrsky.love` file should start the game. On the command line running `love tyrsky.love` should do the trick.
